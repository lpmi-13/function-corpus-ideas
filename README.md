# ideas for a corpus of javascript functions

If we had a whole bunch of functions stored somewhere (dynamo?s3?other?) we could ask questions about them:

- what does the "average" function look like, and is there an "average" function.
- what is the range of different function lengths (and maybe show them in a histogram)?
- what are the different types of complexity in functions?
- what sorts of naming conventions are people using?
- what types of methods on what types of objects are common/uncommon
- prevelence of recursiveness
- prevalence of higher-order functions
- prevalence of semi-colons
- prevalence of anonymous functions
- most recent language function
- prevalence of async/await
- distribution of ES5/ES6 (by which I mean not ES5)
- most common argument names
- distribution of var/let/const
- state management (define this better later)
